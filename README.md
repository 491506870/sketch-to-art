## Installation

### Backend

The server side is powered by Python and Flask. You can see this [simpler example](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp).
Navigate to the `server` directory and all the files concerning the service and neural networks are there. The two main files:

- `app_pix.py` for pix2pix translation
- `app_stylize.py` for arbitrary style transfer

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. And the following key packages are needed:

```
tensorflow
keras
pillow
flask
gevent
```

#### Run

Simply run with python:

```
$ python app_xxx.py
```

And you could see the output indicating the port it's listening (5001 and 5002). Go to `http://localhost:5001` and you should see the returned information.

### Frontend

You should installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:mtobeiyf/sketch-to-art.git
